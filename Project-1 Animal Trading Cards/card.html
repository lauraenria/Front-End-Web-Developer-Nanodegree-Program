            <p>The snow leopard, known for its beautiful, thick fur, has a white, yellowish or soft gray coat with ringed spots of black on brown. The markings help camouflage it from prey. With their thick coats, heavy fur-lined tails and paws covered with
                fur, snow leopards are perfectly adapted to the cold and dry habitats in which they live. Snow leopards prefer to inhabit steep cliff areas, rocky outcrops and ravines. Mostly active at dawn and dusk, snow leopards are rarely seen in the
                wild. Unlike other big cats, snow leopards are unable to roar.Solitary in nature, they pair only during the breeding season.
                <em class="bold">Did you know?</em> Snow leopards have light green or gray eyes, unusual for big cats, who usually have yellow or gold eyes.</p>
