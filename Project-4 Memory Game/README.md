## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

### How to play

* Open [Here](https://codepen.io/LauraEnria/full/yjgPvR/) This is the game.

* Your goal is to match two tiles of the same type at a time.
* Then try to match all pairs in as minimum moves as possible.

### External libraries Used

* jQuery
* bootstrap
